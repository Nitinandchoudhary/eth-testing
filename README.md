# eth-testing
This Ethereum project is just to setup a few lines of business logic so that you can pickup from here.

The actual respository you can find here https://gitlab.com/jklepatch/eattheblocks-pro/-/tree/master/dapp-30/day4-advanced-storage but the problem with this was few files are missing like bundle.js etc. Download this repository first to add the node_modules folder in frontend directory for this project.

And you also get confused with "end" and "start" directories it's just before and after things. So I removed that to make it simple. 

Tip: install web3 manually
