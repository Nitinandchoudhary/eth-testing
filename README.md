# eth-testing
This Ethereum project is just to setup a few lines of business logic so that you can pickup from here.

The actual respository you can find here https://gitlab.com/jklepatch/eattheblocks-pro/-/tree/master/dapp-30/day4-advanced-storage but the problem with this is that there are few files are missing like bundle.js etc

And you also get confused with "end" and "start" directories it's just before and after things. So I removed that to make it simple. 

Tip:Please install web3 manually
